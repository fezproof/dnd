<p>New Korham.</p>
<p>What a shithole.</p>
<p>I mean, if there was ever anyone who was allowed to judge the quality of a town, it would surely be someone who grew up in as shitty a place as Valum Dump. I wouldn’t even stop at this dustbowl of a town if I weren’t just so damn desperate for a good drink.The half-dead mare I’m riding wouldn’t mind a break much either, an old heifer that I managed to “borrow” from some kindly farmers a few villages back. She ain’t the talkative sort, but neither am I, so in the end I figure that we make a decent pair.</p>
<p>I trot my trusty steed down the crowded main street, looking for the local watering hole. Lots of folks coming down the Great Northern Highway these days, making their way south for better opportunities perhaps, maybe hankering for some greener pastures. Mekros, apparently a place filled with hopes like that from what I’ve heard from folks on the road. News to me, at least. Well not that I’m so different. It would seem that in the end, I too am chasing the sweet winds that beckon my name. The only problem is that I’ve yet to figure what the winds want me in particular, but those thoughts will have to wait.</p>
<p>After meandering for a while, I stopped my horse out the front of a place called “The Tipsy Teaspoon”. Not the most intimidating name, but according to the locals, this is the place for my kind around these parts. I tie up my horse, flipping a lad a rusty old copper to water and feed her, not missing the dirty look he pays me when he thinks I’m not looking. I stop briefly in front of the saloon doors, steadying myself for a moment, blending in like Kurtis always taught me. I step through confidently, a grim smirk on my face and my patchwork cloak billowing as if a storm were blowing these doors open in fear of blocking my path.</p>
<p>It's murky inside, the rays from the sparse sunlight piercing through the boarded up blinds around the outer edge. All the better to hide the dirty deeds of the villains within, all seated at the few wooden stools and cramped tables that crowd around the squalid interior. A rough looking bartender wipes filth laden glasses, his scarred, world-weary expression proof enough of their qualifications to sling drinks in a place like this. I take a seat at the bar, a large lumbering bear-like woman sitting beside me, giving me a glance as I set down my tired bones. She, much like just about everyone else in this place, are sizing me up, looking for any signs of weakness, anything for these fucking hyenas to latch onto and rip me to pieces like any other lamb foolish enough to wander into their den.</p>
<p>They find none.</p>
<p>They see a tall, lanky, grime stained dragonborn, his once pearly white scales long dulling over the course of a lifetime of neglect and abuse. His single pointed horn, poking a hole through the dusty, wide brimmed hat atop his lonely head. His worn leather armor, barely covering his vitals, patched and repaired time and time again. It, like him, had seen it’s fair share of scraps and quarrels, too many to even count. The only possession of his in good shape, being the long, ivory white revolver swaying by his side. Seeing that, at least, seems to chide away the hungry eyes.</p>
<p>“What are ya lookin’ for stranger?”</p>
<p>The man behind the bar said, his gruff voice seemingly drawing my attention away from my scattered, drifting thoughts.</p>
<p>“A drink. Some food. A job.”</p>
<p>My gravelly voice spoke concisely, as I find with folk like this, the fewer unnecessary words, the greater the odds of getting what I needed.</p>
<p>“A drink, I can handle.”</p>
<p>He takes the now polished glass in his hands, setting it down whilst he pours from a nozzle taken from below the counter. It appeared that I wouldn’t have much choice in my selection of drinks this afternoon. The glass fills with a dark brew as if by magic, the nozzle some fancy contraption imported from the south. I recognized it by the design on the handle- a heron swallowing a coin, the sigil of the Peterson Merchants Guild. It’s not strange to not notice a sigil that seemed to be imprinted on just about all the damned trash that made its way to the country's dumping ground. What is strange however, are these odd feelings of nostalgia that I feel from seeing it again. I’m not old enough to reminisce about my past. I have more pressing matters that require my attention.</p>
<p>“That’ll be a silver piece for the ale. Food can also be arranged, depending on how peckish ya are. A job, however…”</p>
<p>His tantalising words lead me on as if intentionally baiting my interest. There’s a gleam in his eye as he pauses to gauge my expression.</p>
<p>“What type of job?”</p>
<p>I ask, keeping my demeanor even. It’s best that this fellow doesn’t realise just how strapped for cash I really am. I’d come a long way by this point, desperate to race towards my destination, but an empty coin pouch and growling stomach worked well to keep my wanderlust at bay.</p>
<p>“It’s easy work. Just need some hired hands to escort some carriages south. They’re heading west to the Dynasty, but only require passage up until the Great Divide.”</p>
<p>The Great Divide. A rift of titanic proportions, that even a country bumpkin like myself, had heard of at least once. Of more importance however, this job happened to solve both of my most recent predicaments. The convoy would provide rations and pay for the guards escorting them, but more vitally it would lead me towards the very place that I so eagerly yearned to reach. It was as if Orsoth himself were guiding my path.</p>
<p>The bartender pulled from his pocket a letter that I could only assume to be the job notice in question. I reach my hand out to take it from his grasp.</p>
<p>At this moment, the woman sitting at the counter, who at second glance was not only bear-like, but in fact a native of Storva to the north, a Bearkin, drained her flagon. It was rare seeing one so far south, but it wasn’t my first time tangling with her kind.</p>
<p>“I’ve been looking for a no-brainer job like that for a while, I wouldn’t mind taking that off your hands”</p>
<p>Her deep booming voice, alerting the once dull attention of the parlour, once satisfied by their drinks and idle chatter, now looking forward to a more exciting diversion from their sullen mid-afternoon naps. The woman seemed emboldened by the sudden attention and reached her paw out to receive the letter. Maybe she assumed that I would simply be cowed by the mocking glare that she was shooting me, or perhaps intimidated by the size of the massive, iron war-axe sheathed on her back.</p>
<p>Fat chance of that.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t if I were you grizzly...”</p>
<p>I growl, lightly unbuttoning the strap holding my piece in its holster, openly brandishing it now as a means to swiftly settle down this over excited woodland creature. I'm usually a fan of the small and furry variety, but there was nothing cute about this arrogant beast before me.</p>
<p>“You threatening me, you overgrown newt!”</p>
<p>She angrily yells, furious that I was not only arguing with her, but in fact had the gall to openly threaten her. She reaches behind her back, almost ripping her axe out of its sheath, lifting it high above my head. It didn’t help that I called her a grizzly, they hate being compared to normal animals. But I already knew what would rile up a muscle brain like her.</p>
<p>Her axe swung down, splitting the stool that I was sitting on, with such force that the air itself seemed to scream in pain from the sheer velocity of its swing. The stool was shattered, and even the floor beneath wrecked, but unfortunately for her I was too quick, rolling backwards before her axe even came down. She wrenched the axe embedded in the floorboards, the white fur underneath her heavy armor, bristling with indignation.</p>
<p>“STAY!”</p>
<p>“STILL!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her, no matter how furiously she roared, I couldn't just let her cleave me in two. I had better places to be, and she was now guilty of wasting my time. If before the crowd was quietly watching, they were now hooting and hollering with anticipation, looking forward to see who would triumph over the other, gold changing hands as an impromptu arena formed around us.</p>
<p>The bear didn’t seem to notice, or care, still swinging her axe with reckless abandon, throwing caution to the wind. I ducked and dived, weaving between her death blows. I always was especially quick on my feet, so luckily that made up for my spindly physique. Seeing her tire from her near endless barrage of attacks, I finally decided that now was the perfect time to act. I reached into my pocket and flipped my last silver piece, up into the air to intersect with one of the sparse rays of midday light, redirecting it straight into her right eye mid-swing.</p>
<p>It was only a moment of hesitation, and flinching from the unexpected brightness in such a dim room, but that was all I needed. Taking that moment I drew my gun, the near spotless exterior now visible, exposing the lone star carved on the handle. A single second, a single shot. Right through the center of the now falling coin and into the eye of the unwary bear. It penetrates right through the weak spot of her face, and rips through the freshly torn cavity deep into her skull. That seemed to do the trick.</p>
<p>It always was Curtis’s lucky star.</p>
<p>I pull a torn handkerchief from my pocket, wiping down the residue from the barrel, checking the chamber. Three rounds left. Not much to travel with, but I don’t have enough spare cash to make any more.</p>
<p>At this time the still standing body of the woman seems to finally react to having her brain blown out of her head, falling to the ground with an enormous crash of steel and flesh against the now cracked floorboards. I lean down to check her pockets and find her coin purse- six gold pieces, three silver and twelve copper. I walk back over to the counter, handing the surprised bartender the silver I had shot a hole in and a shiny copper piece, newly liberated from the bear's pocket.</p>
<p>“The silver’s for the drink, the copper for the stool.”</p>
<p>I take the dropped letter off of the counter top and re-holster my weapon after seeing the lack of reaction from the once exuberant crowd. It seems not many bet on my survival, the bear must have been someone of renown around here. Not that I could turn her head in for a bounty, unless I wanted the watch to gladly put me in chains myself. I should probably make myself scarce, before some unwelcome winds start blowing my way.</p>
<p>With the job in hand, and unexpected funds secured, I untied my horse and saddled up. I had yet to order any food, and my stomach was still growling, but I had a critical appointment in Bridge Town that couldn’t wait around for me to finish supper. My foe still drew breath, and with every minute wasted, she escaped further and further from my sight.</p>
<p>A few weeks pass and from a distance, nothing seems to be amiss within this lonely coastal town. Despite the furor of the moment, the life and death of some rabble is of little consequence to these quaint residents. Their lives go on as they always have. The only real change is a new addition on the local bulletin board, a new bounty for the mysterious wanderer that swept through all that time ago.</p>
<p>A single name and hastily drawn caricature, are all that’s known, besides the sky high price put on his head. The fresh ink, still glistening as if lit up by the rays of dawn from the rising sun.</p>
<p>“JERICHO”.</p>
<p>“WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE”.</p>
<p>“500 GOLD”.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></main>
