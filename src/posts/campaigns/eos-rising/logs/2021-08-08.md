name: Session 0
draft: true

A the start of any campaign, it is good to have a Session 0. It gets players invested in their characters, an idea of how the campaign should be player, and to set up boundaries for each other so that everyone has a good time!

---

We did our session 0 in person, a week before the campaign was due to kick off. This is the first time our group had done a session 0 for any campaign, but I had only heard positive things about them from people I knew, and the D&D community at large. They have been considered so important now, that event WotC has put guidelines in their latest source-book [_Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/929-new-players-guide-how-to-make-the-most-of-session 'New Player’s Guide: How to Make the Most of Session Zero').

I decided to use an amazing template by [Bob World Builder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC8AgO4FbP11n_WBdFai7DA "Bob's Youtube page"), which covers almost anything you could need in a session 0. You can find the template for free [here on his Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/39281630 'Session 0 template').

The point of this log is to go over what we discussed in session 0, and note done anything interesting we found as a group when doing it.

## Team building

This is a great topic to start any session 0 with. It may seem a bit silly or pointless at a glance, especially if you know the people you are playing with quite well like we did. However, we quickly noticed found how important the questions we asked were, as everyone was surprised by how some people answered. We decided to go in a circle, and all three questions that are outline in the template.

1. What's one thing you love about RPGs?
2. Are you most excited by combat, exploration and puzzles, or roleplay?
3. As a player, what's one strength you bring to the group?

Here are the answers the players gave.

- Roadkill
  1. Collecting different things, and generally bringing a little chaos and fun
  2. Exploration and puzzles
  3. Creativity and uniqueness, and coming up with the unexpected
- Willabelle
  1. Having a pet Manticore in a previous campaign
  2. Combat
  3. Creativity and flexibility
- Ruerl
  1. Problem solving
  2. Exploration and puzzles
  3. Alternate perspective
- Grub
  1. Progression
  2. Role-play
  3. Moving things forward, and leadership
- Elizabeth
  1. Strategy
  2. Combat
  3. Bringing the chaos!

As you can see, we have interesting but well balanced party!

## Scheduling

I won't go too deep into scheduling here, but it is certainly an important thing to discuss. Some important things we decided though:

- We only like doing 3-4 hour sessions, weekly
- The campaign will be played in arcs. When a section seems to come to a nice conclusion, we will switch DMs and campaigns to let everyone get a chance to play
- If a player is absent, the character will still be around but not doing anything (inactive). We thought this is best for our table, so important character decisions are not made when the player is not there.

## Table expectations

- smartphones
