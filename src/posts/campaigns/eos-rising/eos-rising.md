The calamity has shattered the world. A continent in the sky are all that remains of what is now called Eos, a land split in two by the [[campaigns/eos-rising/places/great-divide|Great Divide]].

Eos is a place full of innovation and exploration, with people of all kinds striving to find a purpose. Some find it in the religious empire of the [[campaigns/eos-rising/organisations/lurin-dynasty|Lurin Dynasty]], while others seek learning and riches working for the merchant guilds of [[campaigns/eos-rising/places/mekros|Mekros]].
