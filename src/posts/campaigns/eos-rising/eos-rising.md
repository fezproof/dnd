The calamity has shattered the world. A continent in the sky are all that remains of what is now called Eos, a land split in two by _[[campaigns/eos-rising/places/the-great-divide|The Great Divide]]_.

Eos is a place full of innovation and exploration, with people of all kinds striving to find a purpose. Some find it in the religious empire of the _Lurin Dynasty_, while others seek learning and riches working for the merchant guilds of _[[campaigns/eos-rising/places/mekros|Mekros]]_.
