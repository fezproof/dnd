The calamity has shattered the world. A continent in the sky are all that remains of what is now called Eos, a land divided in two by the "Great Divide".

Eos is a place full of innovation, exploration, and people of all kinds striving to find a purpose. Some find it in the religous empire of the "Lurin Dynasty". Others seek learnings and riches working for the merchant guilds of "Mekros".
