## Wards

Bridgetown is separated in to wards, which cover the different layers of the city.

### Core

Right in the heart of Bridgetown is the Core Ward. Looking like a huge bee hive attached to the Great Arch, the Core is by far the largest singular structure in Bridgetown. Topping it is the large inn and tavern, the [[campaigns/eos-rising/places/unholy-matrimony|Unholy Matrimony]].

### Spine

Ward that runs the length of Bridgetown. It is topped by the Great Arch, giving it a very strong support along its entire length. Due to this, the Spine Ward is not only densely populated, but most of the foot traffic through Bridgetown goes through it in some way. The [[campaigns/eos-rising/organisations/bridger-gang|Bridger Gang]] keeps a tight grip on its dealing, making sure that nothing happens there without them knowing about it.

### Pride Ward
